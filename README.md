## Description

This app is a quick and easy way to keep yourself on track each day. From 9am to 5pm, each hour has a dedicated row for a quick note or two. Save it, go to lunch, bring the webpage back up, and all of your saved entries will remain in place.<br /><br />
Stay on target time with color-coded hours! Green fields are future hours, the red field is your current hour (hurry up!), and grey input fields are in the past; no looking back!<br /><br />

## Motivation
Our daily minutia is oftentimes too much with which to upkeep on short-term memory alone. By creating an hourly workday scheduler, the tiny tasks that usually get lost in the mix will now have a front-row seat on your personal webpage.<br /><br />

## Usage

  The page is linked to moment.js for the current date and time.

  To make a new entry, select the input area between the HOUR on the left and the SAVE BUTTON on the right. Once you've entered your note, click on the SAVE ICON and the Workday Scheduler will remember it! Enter a new note and re-save in the same hour slot to overwrite, if necessary.</p>

  Upon the page loading, any pre-existing notes will load into the entry fields.<br /><br />
